## 1. Unit Testing Strategy

### Core Components Tested

#### Database Operations (`test_database.py`)
- **Message storage and retrieval** - Ensures data integrity
- **Query performance** - Sub-500ms response times
- **Concurrent access** - Thread-safe operations
- **Data consistency** - ACID compliance verification

**Key Tests:**
```python
def test_save_messages_bulk_performance():
    """Test bulk message insertion meets performance requirements."""
    # Verify >100 messages/second insertion rate

def test_get_recent_messages_accuracy():
    """Test message retrieval accuracy with time filters."""
    # Ensure no messages are lost or incorrectly filtered

def test_concurrent_database_access():
    """Test thread-safe database operations."""
    # Verify data consistency under concurrent load
```

#### Discord API Client (`test_discord_client.py`)
- **Rate limiting compliance** - Respects Discord API limits
- **Error handling** - Graceful failure recovery
- **Message fetching accuracy** - No data loss
- **Authentication handling** - Secure token management

**Key Tests:**
```python
def test_fetch_messages_rate_limiting():
    """Test Discord API rate limit compliance."""
    # Verify 1s delays between channels, 10s between servers

def test_message_fetching_accuracy():
    """Test complete message retrieval without loss."""
    # Ensure incremental fetching captures all new messages

def test_error_recovery():
    """Test graceful handling of API errors."""
    # Verify 403 errors update forbidden channels list
```

#### LLM Integration (`test_llm.py`)
- **Response reliability** - Consistent API interactions
- **Performance benchmarks** - <2s response times
- **Error handling** - Fallback mechanisms
- **Content processing** - Accurate text analysis

## 2. Integration Testing Strategy

### End-to-End Workflows (`test_message_pipeline.py`)

#### Complete Message Processing Pipeline
1. **Discord message fetching** → 2. **Database storage** → 3. **Importance analysis** → 4. **Notification generation**

**Critical Integration Tests:**
```python
def test_end_to_end_message_flow():
    """Test complete message processing pipeline."""
    # Mock Discord API → Save to DB → Analyze importance → Generate notifications
    
def test_concurrent_processing():
    """Test pipeline performance under concurrent load."""
    # Multiple channels/servers processed simultaneously

def test_error_propagation():
    """Test error handling across pipeline stages."""
    # Ensure failures don't break entire system
```

#### External API Integration
- **Discord API interactions** - Mocked for reliability
- **LLM API calls** - Timeout and retry logic
- **Database transactions** - Rollback on failure

## 3. ML Model Testing Strategy

### Importance Detection Accuracy (`test_importance_detection.py`)

#### Model Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: >85% overall classification accuracy
- **Precision**: <15% false positive rate for low importance
- **Recall**: <10% false negative rate for high importance  
- **Response Time**: <50ms per message analysis

#### Test Categories

**Pattern Recognition Tests:**
```python
def test_urgent_message_detection():
    """Test detection of urgent/emergency messages."""
    urgent_cases = [
        "URGENT: Server is down, need immediate help!",
        "Emergency maintenance required ASAP",
        "Critical issue with payment system"
    ]
    # Verify >90% detection rate with high confidence

def test_group_buy_detection():
    """Test group buy and time-sensitive opportunity detection."""
    gb_cases = [
        "New group buy for mechanical keyboards starting tomorrow!",
        "IC for custom keycaps, deadline next week",
        "GB for switches is live, $50 shipping"
    ]
    # Verify >80% detection rate

def test_event_detection():
    """Test meeting and event reminder detection."""
    event_cases = [
        "Meeting tomorrow at 3 PM, don't forget!",
        "Workshop scheduled for next week",
        "Deadline reminder: project due today"
    ]
    # Verify >70% detection rate
```

**Regression Prevention:**
```python
def test_known_good_cases():
    """Test known good cases to prevent regressions."""
    # Maintain performance on previously validated test cases
    
def test_classification_accuracy():
    """Test overall classification accuracy on balanced dataset."""
    # Use labeled dataset with high/medium/low importance examples

def test_false_positive_rate():
    """Test false positive rate on low importance messages."""
    # Ensure casual messages don't trigger false alerts
```

#### Model Reliability Testing

```

**Stress Testing:**
```python

    """Stress test with high message volume."""
    # 50 channels × 100 messages = 5000 messages processed
    # Verify system stability and performance degradation

    """Memory stress test under sustained load."""
    # Monitor memory usage over extended periods
    # Detect memory leaks and excessive usage
```

#### Load Testing Scenarios
